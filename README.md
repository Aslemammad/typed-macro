## üßê Why @typed-macro

There are already many solutions that provide macro capabilities
for Javascript and Typescript projects.
Some of them are very mature, such as [babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros)
(it's awesome, and maybe you will be interested in it).

However, according to my personal experience, they are not suitable for people like me - all my projects are in Typescript, but their support for
Typescript is usually [not so good](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/94).

Also, in those solutions, macros cannot interact with each other,
such as [importing](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/48)
or [nesting](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/173).
And users cannot import macros [like normal functions](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/issues/111).

Most of them are Babel plugins, so they may read something that
has been changed by other plugins but not updated yet (like [bindings](https://github.com/kentcdodds/import-all.macro/issues/7)),
and can't control [its position](https://jamie.build/babel-plugin-ordering.html) in the transformation chain.
But in the modern dev flow, the main pain point of being a Babel plugin may be that
Babel is just a transformer, knowing nothing about modules and dependency graph, which means
they [cannot re-expand macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-preval/issues/19) when changes occurs in dependent external conditions.

üòé **@typed-macro** stands on the shoulders of **Typescript** and **ES Module** - **none of the above problems exist anymore**.
